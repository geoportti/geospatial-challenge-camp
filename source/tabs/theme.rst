Theme
=======

Mobility is an essential aspect of all societies, shaping how people access opportunities, services, and social connections. 
However, it also brings challenges related to environmental impact, congestion, equity, public health, and other societal concerns. 
Sustainable mobility seeks to understand and reimagine these dynamics through spatial, social, and environmental lenses, fostering 
movement that supports well-being, inclusivity, and ecological balance.

This year's Challenge Camp invites participants to explore creative geospatial solutions and ideas that can transform how we 
move toward more sustainable and connected everyday geographies.

Possible application areas include:

- **Active Travel**: How can walking and cycling become safer, more attractive, and better integrated into daily mobility?
- **Shared Mobility and Mobility as a Service (MaaS)**: How can shared bikes, scooters, and other vehicles, together with integrated Mobility as a Service platforms, reduce car dependency and improve accessibility across regions and user groups?
- **Public Transport**: How can buses, trams, and metros become more efficient, inclusive, and connected to other modes of travel?
- **Electrification**: How can the shift toward electric mobility transform urban energy use and infrastructure?
- **Smart Mobility**: How can data, AI, and digital tools help optimize movement and enhance travel experiences?
- **Infrastructure**: How can we design and maintain infrastructure that supports sustainable and multimodal mobility?
- **Resilience**:How can transport systems adapt to climate change and withstand environmental or social disruptions?
- **Accessibility and Environmental Justice**: Who benefits from sustainable mobility, and how can we ensure fair access and distribution of the environmental benefits and burdens?
- **Mobility Behavior**: How do lifestyles, social norms, and new work patterns influence travel choices and sustainability?
- **Green Environments**: How can green spaces and nature be integrated into mobility networks to improve comfort, health, and well-being?


Sub-themes
============

The camp will focus on a set of subthemes that highlight different dimensions of sustainable mobility, offering inspiration 
for diverse perspectives and approaches. These subthemes may evolve and expand as new partners and collaborators join the initiative.
