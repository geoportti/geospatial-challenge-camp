Full schedule
===============

The Challenge Camp runs over 13 weeks and includes three onsite events:

- **Kick-off**: 2 days, 12–13 February
- **Midterm seminar**: 1 day in March (dates and location to be confirmed)
- **Final seminar**: half day, 11 May

In addition to the onsite events, participants will have weekly 2-hour online sessions, starting once groups have been formed and begin working on their challenges. 
These online sessions provide guidance, feedback, and collaboration opportunities, complementing the independent work required throughout the course.

**Note**: Weeks with onsite events do not have online meetings, and there will be a couple of fully independent weeks for uninterrupted group work.
