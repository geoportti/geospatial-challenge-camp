Full schedule
===============

The Challenge Camp runs over 13 weeks and includes three onsite events:

- **Kick-off**: 2 days, **12–13 February 2026**, at the  City Center Campus, University of Helsinki
    - *Day 1*: Porthania Building, P674 (Thursday 12th)
    - *Day 2*: Main Building, Studium 1 (Friday 13th)
- **Midterm seminar**:  **25 March 2026**, Turku or Helsinki (location to be confirmed)
- **Final event**: **11 May 2026**, Porthania Building, PIII, at the City Center Campus, University of Helsinki

In addition to the onsite events, participants will **have weekly 2-hour online sessions**, starting once groups 
have been formed and begin working on their challenges. These online sessions provide guidance, feedback, 
and collaboration opportunities, complementing the independent work required throughout the course.

**Note**: Weeks with onsite events do not have online meetings, and there will be a couple of fully independent weeks for uninterrupted group work. 
More detailed schedule will be announced closer to the beginning of the challenge camp.
