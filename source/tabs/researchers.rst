Learning objectives
-------------------

- Students will work in multidisciplinary teams to identify and analyze complex societal challenges related to location and time
- The aim is to design geospatial data- and technology-based solutions addressing real-world problems, with potential sustainability impacts for both users and society at large
- The camp will connect researchers from diverse disciplines with societal actors, data providers, companies, NGOs, and innovation community stakeholders
- Teams will present their solutions at the final public seminar to stakeholders, other teams, and the broader audience

Learning outcomes
-----------------

After completing the course, participants will:

- Have enhanced scientific skills in conceptualizing complex, location-related societal challenges, with a stronger understanding of how these challenges can be addressed using geospatial data, geoprocessing, automation, and digital technologies.
- Develop technical, hands-on competencies to identify, utilize, assess, process, and enrich geospatial data and digital technologies in designing solutions that meet the needs of challenge stakeholders.
- Be able to plan and manage teamwork over several weeks, establishing sub-goals, milestones, and deliverables, while recognizing the roles and responsibilities of team members in relation to overall project outcomes.
- Gain confidence in working within multidisciplinary teams, including assessing progress, communicating results effectively, and engaging with stakeholders from diverse backgrounds.


Credits
-------

Participation and completion of the course is 5 ECTS. PhD and MSc students will receive
credits from their respective home institutions. Students not enrolled in a PhD or MSc programme
should discuss the credit arrangements with the Challenge Camp staff prior to registration.
