Researchers and Students
========================

This 13-week, challenge-based course (5 ECTS) offers doctoral, post-doctoral, and master’s students from 
universities and research organizations the opportunity to tackle challenges related to the theme in 
cross-disciplinary teams. Working closely with mentors and societal stakeholders, participants co-create sustainable 
geospatial solutions that address concrete needs in society. Through this process, they will develop their skills in teamwork, 
innovation, and stakeholder collaboration while learning to apply digital and spatial technologies for real-world impact.

The course starts with a two-day kickoff event, includes a midterm seminar, and concludes with a public final event where 
teams present their solutions to stakeholders, peers, and the wider community. Participants are expected to attend all 
on-site events and take part in weekly facilitated mentoring and group meetings, while additional teamwork is organized 
independently by each team.
