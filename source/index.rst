Overview
========

The Geospatial Challenge Camp is a skills development service of `Geoportti Research Infrastructure <https://www.geoportti.fi/>`__ , 
a Finnish national research infrastructure providing geospatial data, tools, and computing resources for research and education, and
an innovation development service of `Location Innovation Hub (LIH) <https://www.maanmittauslaitos.fi/en/locationinnovationhub>`__ , one of the
European Digital Innovation Hubs.

This 13-week, challenge-based course (5 ECTS) gives doctoral, post-doctoral, and master’s students from Finnish universities and research organizations 
the opportunity to tackle real-world challenges in cross-disciplinary teams, collaborating closely with mentors and societal stakeholders.

The course focuses on identifying and analyzing complex societal problems related to location and time, and on designing and developing digital, impact-driven, sustainable solutions.
Participants will enhance their professional skills in using data, technology, and application innovations.

Challenges are posed by societal actors, data providers, companies, NGOs, and innovation community actors, offering participants the opportunity to translate 
geospatial and data science solutions into practical applications and create broader societal impact in Finland and beyond.
